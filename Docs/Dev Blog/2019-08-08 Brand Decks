This has nothing to do with code but fuck it, I'm writing it in one of these anyway.

To decide on the fundamental brand values of the Dailies, we have to create a consensus synthesis of a few different options. In other words, I'm going to come up with a few different directions we could go and make a brand deck for each, I'll present them all in a stream, and we'll create a new brand deck with the parts we like from each of the proposals.

For each direction I'll need to come up with
- Title
- Colors
- Mission Statement
- Key values list

Some brand directions to choose from
- Collective: coming together, in it together, doing it together. Everything, inclusive, open, but also tight-knit and well-regulated. What matters most is what matters to all of us, because what really matters most is that we're doing it together
- Elite: Smart, clever, savvy. Luxurious. What matters most is what the people with power are doing, and we can be powerful by keeping track of them.
- Irreverent: Don't take it too seriously, you'll never get out alive. Light, fun, cheerful, silly. What matters most is whatever we enjoy most.
- Celebration: It's fun cause we're all together. Exciting, open, warm, lively. It's a party. What matters most is whatever makes us happiest.
- Growth: It's good because it makes us better. Powerful, fertile, strong, holistic, truthful. What matters most is what helps us understand, because really we're here to learn
- Saviors: We're here to help people. Healing, soothing, safe, noble, motivated, optimistic, positive. Hopeful. What matters most is wherever we can make the most difference.
- Revolutionary Underground: We're here to cause trouble. Open people's eyes, get them mad, get them involved. Spread the knowledge you won't get in the mainstream. Dangerous, cutting edge, clear-eyed, smart, badass, strong, scary. What matters most is whatever's most fucked up.
