OK, so, welcome to the Dev Blog for the new OurDailies app. Ideally this will live at OurDailies.org/Dev someday, but right now I don't have any hosting so I'm just throwing it in this folder and putting that in git. 

The idea is basically that I hate cluttering up code with long comments, but I do want a place to record my thinking as I'm writing and figuring things out. I am FAR from an expert, or even experienced, coder, so most of the things I'm doing I'll be figuring out as I go. This means I might do some silly things that don't make sense once I understand things better, or that I might only be able to figure something out based on some obscure forum answer I find somewhere that I won't be able to track down again easily later, and I want to put all the necessary explanations (and then some) somewhere so I can find them again easily later.

On top of that, my ideal of clean code has been to not leave comments that would be unnecessary to someone who speaks the language fluently. But "fluently" is a pretty high bar. So I'd like to use these documents to leave little notes to my future self that a more experienced coder might not need. Little quirks of syntax, or notes on how a specific function works, or anything like that.

Basically I'm trying to balance the virtues of clean code with the value of having really excessive notes about how the app works and what I was thinking when I wrote it, and this seems like a good way to broker that compromise. Maybe it isn't, I don't know. But for now it seems like it will be, so here we are.

Anyway, enjoy.
