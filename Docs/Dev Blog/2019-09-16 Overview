From a technical standpoint, what we have here is a public database and some tools for interacting with it.

The database is hosted on Heroku as a Prisma endpoint for a MYSQL database.

The public must become members in order to use the database, but once they do they have two tools
-The OurDailies.org app
-The Twitch chat extension

Both of these tools interface with the database through a graphql-yoga server, also running on Heroku. Although it can be found at playground.ourdailies.org, it's important to note that it is an entirely separate app, only sharing a domain.

So the full stack is
-A MYSQL database
-A Prisma endpoint for that database
-A graphql-yoga managed Express server to resolve requests on that endpoint
--A Next.js app that runs React-with-Apollo
--A Chrome extension that processes Twitch chat
